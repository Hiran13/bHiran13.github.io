        year: "2014-2017"
        desc: "I graduated from K.B. Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research in 2017 with a Bachelor in Pharmacy degree. During my four year studying there, I learnt a variety of different subjects such as Pharmaceutical formulations, Chemistry, Pharmacognosy, Pharmacology and Quality Analysis. For my final year elective course, I choose Good Clinical Practices and as part of the course, undertook a 6 month observational clinical study on patients with Type 2 Diabetes. It was here that I first got exposed to Clinical Research and enjoyed the entire process from planning the protocol to executing it."

      - title: "Master's"
        year: "2017-2019"
        desc: "After my Bachelor's in Pharmacy, I obtained a Master's in Pharmacology from L.M. College of Pharmacy in 2019. During my two years there, I conducted one year of pre-clinical research work towards my dissertation. The area of work was cognitive deficits observed in Schizophrenia and I utilized rats for my animal experiments. I learned valuable research skills such as conducting review of literature, hypothesis development planning a protocol, scheduling experiments, ethics committee approvals, responsible conduct of research and result analysis. Individual projects also helped me hone necessary soft skills such as communication skills, time management, prioritization, planning and quality by design."

      - title: "Present"
        year: "2021"
        desc: "Currently, I am working as a Pharmacy Assistant for almost two years now at a busy retail pharmacy. Working with increased volume due to pandemic, the work posed some unique challenges but was also a learning opportunity. I perform a variety of duties here such as processing prescriptions, inventory management, process recalls, follow-ups with patients and other clients, organize and support vaccination clinics. As a pharmacy that administered COVID-19 vaccines, I also got exposure to the provincial vaccine management database software called CovaxOn. It provided me with an opportunity to explore Canadian Healthcare from an integral point."
